# Step 4 - "vagrant up" - Start Up Your VM

Now it's time to fire up your dev VM.  You do this by issueing the "vagrant up" command.

```
cd <path-to-local-forked-git-repo>/vagrant

vagrant up
```

And then you wait.........and wait............................and wait

Seriously, don't be alarmed if this takes up to 20 - 30 minutes.  There's a lot it needs to do the first time.

If it takes longer than an hour, if it hangs, or if it errors out, see [Troubshooting Guide](troubleshooting-setup.md)
