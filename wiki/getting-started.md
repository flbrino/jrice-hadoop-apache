# Getting Started 

Here's what's you ned to get started:

1. [Clone this Repo to your Local Machine](clone-this-repo.md)

2. [Intall Virtual Box & Vagrant](install-virtual-box-vagrant.md)

3. [Customize your environment](customize-environment.md)

4. [Type "vagrant up" in <local-repo-folder>/vagrant.](vagrant-up.md)
    
5. Get coffee, do your taxes, read War and Peace.  Keep banging away at code.  Wait 20 - 30 minutes for first time install *

6. [SSH into your new VM](ssh-into-vm.md)

What's Next?

\* Yeah, it takes a while on first load.  It has to download big files and install a bunch of stuff.  
   But it's a 1-time hit.  After initial install, "vagrant up" takes ~1 - 2 minutes.  Then, you're rocking and rolling all day.
