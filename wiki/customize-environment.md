# Customize Your Environment

Before firing up the VM for the first time, it would be helpful to customize a few things for your specific setup.

This project tries to work with your current workflow and setup and not force you into a convention that may not work for you.

At the same time, it tries to keep things consistent inside the VM to make it easier for folks to share scripts, recipes, and such among team members without a lot of hassle.
